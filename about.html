		<p>Hello.</p>
		<p>My name is David Weintrop and I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://cemse.uchicago.edu/" class="ext-link" target="_blank">UChicago STEM Education</a> working with Diana Franklin in the Computer Science Education group. I received my PhD in the Learning Sciences at <a href="http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/" class="ext-link" target="_blank"> Northwestern University</a> working with Uri Wilensky in the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/" class="ext-link" target="_blank">Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling</a>. My research focuses on the design and implementation of accessible and engaging programming environments that support learners in successfully encoding their own ideas in computationally meaningful ways. This includes questions of interface design, language features, and ways of leveraging the prior knowledge and experiences learners bring to an activity. I am also interested in the use of technological tools in supporting the exploration of non-computer science subjects, particularly within the STEM disciplines. My work lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, computer science education, and the Learning Sciences. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://eecs.umich.edu/" class="ext-link" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> and spent five years working at a pair of startups as a software developer before beginning graduate school. </p>
		<p>I am currently working on a number of projects, including:
		<ul>
		 <li>comparing <a href="#projects">blocks-based and text-based programming environments</a> in high school computer science classrooms</li>
		 <li>developing <a href="#projects?hybrid">hybrid blocks/text programming tools</a></li>
		 <li>creating <a href="#projects?ct-stem">computational thinking enhanced activities</a> for high school math and science classrooms</li>
		 <li> designing <a href="#projects?program-to-play"><i>Program-to-Play</i> video games</a></li>
		 <li> helping to write the <a href="http://k12cs.org" class="ext-link" target="_blank">K-12 CS Framework</a>.</li>
	 </ul> 
	 </p>
		<p>In my free time I like to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/394795-dweintrop?shelf=read&sort=date_read&view=covers" class="ext-link" target="_blank">read</a>, listen to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/dweintrop" class="ext-link" target="_blank">music</a>, and travel.</p>
