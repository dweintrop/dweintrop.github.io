		<p>Hello.</p>
		<p>My name is David Weintrop and I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="#">Learning Sciences</a> at <a href="#">Northwestern University</a>. My advisor is <a href="#">Prof. Uri Wilensky</a> and I am a member of the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-based Modeling (<a href="#">CCL</a>). My research focuses on the design and implementation of accessible and engaging programming environments that support learners in successfully encoding their own ideas in computationally meaningful ways. This includes questions of interface design, language features, and ways of leveraging the prior knowledge and experiences learners bring to an activity. I am also interested in the use of technological tools in supporting the exploration of non-computer science subjects, particularly within the STEM disciplines. My work lies at the intersection of computer science, cognitive science, and the learning sciences. I have a B.S. in <a href="#">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="#">University of Michigan</a> and spent five years working at a pair of software startups (<a href="#">Baskstop Solutions Group</a> and <a href="#">Incisent Technologies</a>) as a software developer before returning to graduate school. </p>
		<p>I am currently working on a number of projects, including:
		<ul>
		 <li>comparing <a href="#">blocks-based and text-based programming environments</a> in high school computer science classrooms</li>
		 <li>developing <a href="#">hybrid blocks/text programming tools</a></li>
		 <li>creating <a href="#">computational thinking enhanced activities</a> for high school math and science classrooms</li>
		 <li> designing <a href="#"><i>Program-to-Play</i> video games</a></li> 
		 </p>
		<p>In my free time I like to <a href="#">read</a>, go see <a href="#">music</a>, and <a href="#">travel</a>.</p>
