          <h2>Comparing Blocks-based and Text-based Programming</h2>
          <p>Blocks-based programming environments are growing in popularity and are increasingly being used in formal introductory programming contexts. To date, much of the work evaluating such tools has focused on their effectiveness in out-of-school contexts and emphasized engagement and attitudinal measures over content mastery. Given their growing presence in classrooms, it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks to the use of the blocks-based programming approach in formal learning contexts.</p>
          <p>For my dissertation I am investigating the differences between blocks-based, text-based, and hybrid blocks/text introductory programming tools. To understand the afordances and drawbacks of different programming modalities, I am carrying out a mixed-method, quasi-experimental study in high school computer science classes. The goal of this work is to better understand the tools we are using to introduce today’s learners to computer science and lay the foundation for creating the tools of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>I have written-up a number of versions of my dissertation study, including a <a href="/papers/Weintrop-diss-2pager.pdf" class="paper">2-page summary</a>, a <a href="/papers/Weintrop-diss-4pager.pdf" class="paper">4-page summary</a>, and a <a href="/papers/Weintrop-diss-proposal.pdf" class="paper">73-page formal proposal</a>.

          <h2>Hybrid Blocks/Text Programming Environments</h2>
          <p>As part of my dissertation study, I have created two hybrid blocks/text programming environments. Both environments were designed to have 3 distinct modes (a block version, a text version and a hybrid block/text version) and were used by 3 classes of high-school students for 5-weeks. Findings from the use of these tools in the classroom can be found on the <a href="#pubs">publications</a> page.</p>
          <h3>Pencil.cc</h3>
          <p>Pencil.cc is my fork of the <a href="https://github.com/PencilCode/pencilcode" class="gh">Pencil Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PencilCode/droplet" class="gh">Droplet</a> projects. Droplet is a browser-based editor that seamlessly convert programs between blocks-based to text-based forms. Pencil Code is a more fully featured development environment build with Droplet that adds a Logo-esque library and visual executation space for learners to use. My fork of these tools adds new hybrid blocks/text features as well as advanced logging and a number of other UI features to support research.</p>
          <p>You can play with Pencil.cc <a href="http://pencil.cc" class="ext-link">here</a> and see the code <a href="https://github.com/dweintrop/pencilcode" class="gh">here</a>.

          <h3>Snappier!</h3>
          <p>In the fall of 2014 I ran a pilot of my blocks/text comparison study using a modified version of the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/" class="ext-link">Snap!</a> programming environment. In my modified version students could view JavaScript implementaitons of the graphical scripts they had assembled as well as had the ability to define new custom blocks using JavaScript.</p>

          <h2>Program-to-Play Video Games</h2>
          <p>The defining feature of program-to-play games is the use of programming as a central gameplay mechanism through which the player interacts with the game. Central to program-to-play games is the challenge of having players conceive of a strategy and then figure out how to encode that idea using the tools provided by the game’s programming tools. Doing so shifts gameplay away from in-the-moment reaction and reflex, towards a more deliberate, premeditated, and thoughtful gameplay interaction, with programming spurring and mediating in-game design thinking. During gameplay, players engage in numerous authentic programming practices including programmatically expressing ideas, constructing and manipulating computational abstractions, iteratively developing solutions, and debugging constructed artifacts.

          <img src="images/roboBuilder-img.gif" alt="RoboBuilder" style="width:50%;margin-left:-14px;"/>
          <p>RoboBuilder is a game I developed and used as part of a study exploring the affordances of program-to-play games. In case you have not heard, RoboBuilder is currently sweeping the nation. </p>
          <p>If you want to try out RoboBuilder, you can get it <a href="RoboBuilder.zip" class="paper">here</a>.</p> 
          Instructions to RoboBuilder:
          <ol>
            <li>Unpack RoboBuilder.zip</li>
            <li>Double-clik robocode.jar</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>If you are interested to see how RoboBuilder works, you can download the source code <a href="RoboBuilder_src.zip" class="paper">here</a>.RoboBuilder was developed using eclipse, so the src zip includes a .project file that will allow you to import roboBuilder into eclipse as an existing project. </p>
          <p>This project relies heavily on the OpenBlocks library and the <a href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net/" class="ext-link">RoboCode</a> game, so please check those out!</p>

          <h2>Computational Thinking in STEM</h2>
          <p>Computational thinking plays an increasingly important role in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Yet, many high school students never encounter computational thinking in their day-to-day coursework. This NSF funded project develops <a href="http://ct-stem.northwestern.edu/lesson-plans/" class="ext-link" target="blank">computational thinking activities</a> that can be embedded in existing high school STEM courses (CT-STEM). As part of the project, we developed a <a href="/papers/Weintrop_et_al_AERA_2014.pdf" class="paper">Computational Thinking in Math and Sciences Skills Taxonomy</a> along with a series of computational thinking in STEM assessments, read about the assessments <a href="/papers/Weintrop_et_al_INTETAIN_2014.pdf" class="paper">here</a> or <a href="http://ct-stem-assess.herokuapp.com/guest/login/" class="ext-link" target="_blank">try them yourself</a>.</p>
